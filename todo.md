## Mega Dropdown Rebuild (Gymshark Exact)

- [x] Rebuild mega dropdown: two-panel layout (left categories + right sub-items), pure white background
- [x] Dropdown opens ONLY on hover over nav item, closes immediately when mouse leaves entire dropdown area
- [x] Left panel: large clean category names with chevron arrows (Sepeda Listrik, Batre, Sparepart)
- [x] Right panel: sub-items appear when hovering a category, plain text links, no headers/columns
- [x] No gray background, no complex grid, no category headers — clean minimal like Gymshark
- [x] Smooth fade transition, thin top border separator only

## Dropdown Fix (Compact + No Gap)

- [x] Compact dropdown: max-width 520–720px, absolute under nav item, no full-screen width
- [x] Consistent white background throughout (no grey area)
- [x] No transparent gap between nav item and dropdown panel (position: absolute, top: 100%, no margin-top)
- [x] Hover bridge: wrap nav item + dropdown in same parent, hover on either keeps it open
- [x] Two-column layout: left categories (hover to reveal) + right sub-items list
- [x] Proper padding: 24–32px inside, 12–16px vertical spacing between links
- [x] Active category: bold + underline indicator
- [x] "Lihat Semua" as subtle secondary link at bottom
- [x] Smooth opacity + translateY transition (150–200ms)
- [x] Mobile: accordion menu instead of hover dropdown

## New Catalog Pages + Navigation Fix

- [x] Fix dropdown: category names changed from <button> to <Link> so they are real clickable links
- [x] Fix dropdown: Sepeda Listrik → /sepeda-listrik (was /catalog/sepeda-listrik)
- [x] Fix dropdown: Batre → /batre (was /catalog/batre)
- [x] Fix dropdown: Sparepart → /sparepart (was /catalog/sparepart)
- [x] Fix mobile accordion: category names are now real links with separate expand chevron
- [x] Create /batre page — exact Sepeda Listrik layout, 9 products, filter chips (Greenlife/TNE/Chilwee/Lithium)
- [x] Create /sparepart page — exact Sepeda Listrik layout, 11 products, filter chips (Motor/Controller/Charger/Rem/Ban)
- [x] Wire /sepeda-listrik, /batre, /sparepart routes in App.tsx
- [x] Keep /catalog/:category legacy routes for backward compatibility
